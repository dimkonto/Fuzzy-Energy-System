# Fuzzy-Energy-System
A fuzzy logic energy system featuring rule generation with decision trees. The rule base was optimized with a hybrid feature selector. The system was applied on residential energy data for appliance consumption as a case study.

This project contains the code and experiments of my 2020-2021 publication. This work is a contribution towards my PhD studies.
